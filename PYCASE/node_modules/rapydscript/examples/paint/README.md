This paint app is meant to showcase RapydScript simplicity and power. It employs multiple features of RapydScript as well as RapydML and RapydCSS, it shows DRY (don't repeat yourself) coding style when writing RapydScript as well as building the webpage itself in RapydML. It uses multiple HTML5 features to cleanly separate CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. This app also showcases RapydScript's ability to integrate with other widgets and frameworks (jQuery, jQuery UI, and Farbtastic widget). It leverages many of JavaScript's design patterns (closures/function generators) while still keeping the code clean, as one would expect in Python. It might be hard to tell from this example alone, but it is also extremely efficient. The paint-bucket algorithm, for example, when implemented in Pyjamas, takes over a second to complete (and only works in Firefox), but is instantaneous here and works in all browsers.
